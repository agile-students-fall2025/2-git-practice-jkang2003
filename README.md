[From Black Box to Blueprint: Thoughtworks Uses Generative AI to Extract Legacy System Functionality](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/09/tw-blackbox/) — InfoQ (September 2025)

Thoughtworks tackled a legacy system that had no source code and used generative AI to map out a functional spec in just two weeks. They pulled info from the UI, database schema, and binaries while having domain experts double-check everything. I think it’s cool how AI sped up the grunt work—like decoding binaries and tracking how the UI changes the database—while still making it clear that humans need to verify the results. It shows how AI can make reverse engineering faster without losing accuracy.
